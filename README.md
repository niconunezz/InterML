# InterML
### tiny version of ml-framework just for sake of learning the internals of machine learning
#### the main idea is create something that can train neural networks without using any external library
### Idea
#### inspired in micro-grad and tiny-grad, just a shitty version of the internals of machine learning, the only aim of this project is to learn about how tensors and backprop work, and in generall get better at AI.


### Name
#### name references Inter Milan football club but actually comes from INTERnal-MachineLearning, i just though it was funny :)
